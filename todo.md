# TODO

- [ ] TICKET-005: Run full maintenance smoke test once the portal can accept a new request (submit a real ticket, validate TinyFish response plus landing-page count update).
- [ ] TICKET-006: Design/ticket the SMS credential capture flow: prompt for portal URL, username, password, and consent before storing them (encrypted vault) for MVP.
- [ ] TICKET-007: Design an SMS remediation path when portals ask for extra/unspecified info (send targeted "need more info" prompts, capture data, keep user in the loop).
